The Yorùbá Flickr Audio Caption Corpus (YFACC) dataset extends the [Flickr8k
image-text dataset](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398) to Yorùbá with
three modalities:

1. Yorùbá translations of 6k of the captions.
2. Corresponding spoken recordings of these translations, obtained from a
   single speaker.
3. Temporal alignments of 67 Yorùbá keywords for a subset of 500 of the
   captions.

The dataset is described in the following paper. Please cite the paper if you
use the data:
